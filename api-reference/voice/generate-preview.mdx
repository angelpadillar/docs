## Preview Guidelines

### Text Recommendations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Optimal Text Length">
    - **Short test**: 10-30 words for quick quality check
    - **Medium test**: 50-100 words for comprehensive evaluation
    - **Full test**: 100-500 words for complete voice assessment
    - **Avoid**: Very short texts (under 5 words) may not showcase voice quality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Suggestions">
    **For LinkedIn Outreach:**
    ```
    "Hi [Name], I hope you're having a great week! I came across your profile and was impressed by your experience in [industry]. I'd love to connect and share some insights that might be valuable for your work."
    ```

    **For General Testing:**
    ```
    "This is a test of my voice clone quality. I'm checking for naturalness, clarity, and overall sound. The voice should sound smooth and professional."
    ```

    **For Emotional Range:**
    ```
    "I'm excited to share this opportunity with you! It's been an amazing journey, and I believe this could be incredibly valuable. What do you think?"
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Quality Assessment">
    Listen for:
    - **Naturalness**: Does it sound human and conversational?
    - **Clarity**: Are words pronounced clearly?
    - **Consistency**: Is the voice stable throughout?
    - **Emotion**: Does it convey the intended tone?
    - **Similarity**: Does it match your original voice?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
